# FrameBuffer
Simple light weight direct frame buffer rendering with a built in font. Just one header and source file. 

I wrote this as I wanted a simple and easy way to render stuff on the Raspberr Pi without trying to get SDL2 to work in the console. This is just a plug'n'play source file to ad gfx to your console app. Ideal for building GUI's using them small displays you can buy for the Raspberry PI.
